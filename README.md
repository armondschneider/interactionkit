### InteractionKit

A collection of UI interactions that often get overlooked. Copy and paste them into your projects.

### About

This repo is for interactions that get overlooked — smooth animations, intuitive gestures, and polished micro-interactions that make interfaces feel alive. Each component is built to be copied and pasted directly into your project.

### Tech Stack

All components use:
- **React** — Component framework
- **Tailwind CSS** — Styling
- **Framer Motion** — Animations
- **Lucide Icons** — Icons (you can replace with other icon libraries)

```bash
If you use a different icon library, just be aware you'll need to swap out the Lucide imports.
``` 
### Components

- **Sheet** — Bottom sheet with drag-to-close gesture
- **ImageExpand** — Expandable image stack with smooth transforms
- More coming soon...

### Usage

1. Copy the component code from `src/components/`
2. Paste into your project
3. Make sure you have the dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install framer-motion lucide-react
```

4. Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured in your project
